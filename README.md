## How to Call Spotify_Search
Spacing is king. It's how the bot will format your request.
The proper format for calling /u/spotify_search is:

### Song

For a single song and no specified artist:

```
/u/spotify_search song: song_name_here

/u/spotify_search song: Prayer in C - Robin Schulz Radio Edit
```
Song names aren't case sensitive, but they are context sensitive so you should include all grammatical markings and spaces.

### Artist

For a list of top songs by an artist:

```
/u/netflixbot artist: artist_name_here

/u/netflixbot artist: Jay Z
```
Again artist names are not case sensitive, but always include any special characters and spaces.

### Specified Song and Artist

To search a specific song by a specific artist:

```
/u/netflixbot song: Human artist: The Killers

/u/netflixbot artist: Childish Gambino song: Sober

/u/netflixbot song: All Day artist: Kanye West
```
The order of 'song:' and 'artist:' doesn't matter. Always remember to seperate things with spaces.

### Important Notes
* It must be "/u/spotify_search" with both '/' on all call lines
* All calls must be on their own comment
* Capitlization does not matter
* Song titles must match exactly
* There can be spaces between items
